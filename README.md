# 🌟 Community-Endorsed Interest-Free Loans

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 platform that democratizes access to interest-free loans! This project addresses the real-world problem of financial exclusion, where traditional banking systems deny loans to individuals without credit history or collateral, particularly in underserved communities. By leveraging community endorsements on the Stacks blockchain, users can secure loans based on trusted peer verifications rather than centralized credit scores. Loans are interest-free to promote social good, with repayments enforced transparently via smart contracts. The system uses Clarity for secure, auditable logic and involves 8 interconnected smart contracts to handle registration, endorsements, verification, funding, and more.

## ✨ Features

🔒 Immutable audit trails for all transactions  

## 🛠 How It Works

This system operates on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. Community members pool funds into shared vaults, and borrowers request loans backed by verified endorsements from trusted peers. Endorsements act as "social collateral," triggering loan approvals once a threshold is met. All processes are decentralized, ensuring no single entity controls the funds.

**For Borrowers**  
- Register your profile and request endorsements from community members.  
- Once endorsements are verified and meet the required trust score, submit a loan request with amount and repayment terms.  
- Funds are disbursed from the loan pool if approved.  
- Repay on schedule to build reputation and unlock higher limits.  

**For Endorsers**  
- Verify and endorse users you trust (e.g., based on real-world relationships).  
- Earn small rewards from the system's governance token pool for accurate endorsements (if loans are repaid).  
- Risk a stake if endorsed borrowers default, encouraging honest verifications.  

**For Lenders/Fund Contributors**  
- Deposit funds into community pools to support interest-free lending.  
- Vote on governance proposals to influence loan parameters.  
- Withdraw principal with optional rewards from repaid loans.  

**For Verifiers/Community**  
- Use tools to check endorsement validity and loan status.  
- Participate in disputes to resolve issues fairly.  

The system comprises 8 smart contracts for modularity and security:  
1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Handles user registration, profiles, and basic KYC-like metadata storage.  
2. **EndorsementManager.clar**: Allows users to submit and track endorsements, calculating trust scores.  
3. **VerificationOracle.clar**: Integrates with external oracles (if needed) to verify endorsement authenticity (e.g., off-chain proofs).  
4. **LoanRequest.clar**: Manages loan applications, including amount, duration, and endorsement checks.  
5. **FundingPool.clar**: Oversees community fund pools, deposits, and disbursements.  
6. **RepaymentTracker.clar**: Enforces repayment schedules, handles defaults, and distributes incentives.  
7. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Enables token-based voting for system parameters like endorsement thresholds or reward rates.  
8. **DisputeResolution.clar**: Facilitates community-voted resolutions for disputes, with escrow for penalties.  

These contracts interact seamlessly: For example, LoanRequest calls EndorsementManager to check scores before triggering FundingPool for disbursement. Deploy them on Stacks for Bitcoin-secured transactions!
